## Projects

### NBA Prediction Outcomes
- Created a machine learning algorithm to predict the outcome of any given NBA game.
- Obtained and analyzed over 23,000 games from the 2003 season and beyond 
- Data cleaned and featured engineered through domain knowledge and additional exploratory analysis using Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Pandas, and NumPy
- Created several different models using various techniques and ultimately obtained an accuracy score of 67%

### Movie Recommendation Systems
- Used MovieLens data to recommend movies to any given user
- Retrieved over 100,000 movie ratings from MovieLens and performed exploratory data analysis using Statsmodel, Scikit-learn, Seaborn and Matplotlib
- Created a final model using KNN means and KNN baseline in order to retrieve an RMSE score of 0.8 (ratings on a 5 pt. scale)

### Tanzanian Water Well Crisis
- Created a model using Tanzanian water well data from Kaggle to predict which water wells were functional and which were not
- Sourced 59,000 observations on Tanzanian water well data and used exploratory data analysis to better understand features
- Data cleaned initial observations and featured engineered over 100+ new features
- Created 6 different binary classification models, with our final model at an 82% accuracy score.

### Housing Price Predictor
- Utilized machine learning algorithms to forecast housing prices based on available and engineered features. 
- Aggregated data from zillow.com and generated data from niche.com with web scraping. 
- Conducted EDA using Seaborn, Numpy, and Scikit-learn for data cleaning and feature engineering 
- Utilized linear regression to create a prediction model based on feature selection using wrapper tests.
